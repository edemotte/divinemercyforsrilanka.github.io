Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.\nThe words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.\nCast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.\n But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.

Everything that we have built, in our lives so far, is now crumbling before our own eyes. Fear, frustration and uncertainty about what will happen to our lives tomorrow have surrounded us. God our father, we have no comfort in this  life, other than your refuge. \nTherefore, we beseech thee, remembering the words of thy son, our Savior, Lord Jesus Christ, \"I will return on to you\".  \nDear Father God, please send, Lord Jesus as soon as possible, to establish His kingdom on this earth, so that it may overcome the dominion of the dark angels, and peace and happiness will be there forever. \nHave mercy on us and do not delay His second coming any longer O God our Father, Amen.",

The heart of My beloved must resemble Mine; from her heart must spring the fountain of My mercy for souls; otherwise I will not acknowledge her as Mine.\n  On several occasions, I have learned how some religious defend their own glory under the pretext of being concerned for the glory of God, whereas it is not a question of the glory of God, but of glory of self. O Jesus, how painful this has been for me! What secrets the day of Your judgment will bring to light! How can one steal God's gifts? \n(1148,1149,Diary of Blessed Sister M.Faustina Kowalska)",

I understand that the bride must herself share in everything that is the groom's; and so His cloak of mockery must cover me, too. At those times when I suffer much, I try to remain silent, as I do not trust my tongue which, at such moments, is inclined to talk for itself, while its duty is to help me praise God for all the blessings and gifts which He has given me. When I receive Jesus in Holy Communion, I ask Him fervently to deign to heal my tongue so that I would offend neither God nor neighbor by it. I want my tongue to praise God without cease. Great are the faults committed by the tongue. The soul will not attain sanctity if it does not keep watch over its tongue. (Diary 92 Sister M .Faustina)",

Practice the third degree of humility; that is, not only must one refrain from explaining and defending oneself when reproached with something, but one should rejoice at the humiliation.\n If the things you are telling me really come from God prepare your soul for great suffering. You will encounter disapproval and persecution. They will look upon you as a hysteric and an eccentric, but the Lord will lavish His graces upon you. True works of God always meet opposition and are marked by suffering. If God wants to accomplish something, sooner or later He will do so in spite of the difficulties. Your part, in the meantime, is to arm yourself with great Patience.  (Dairy Sister, M Faustina 270)",

Here, too, My Heart finds disappointment; I do not find complete surrender to My love. So many reservations, so much distrust, so much caution. To comfort you, let Me tell you that there are souls living in the world who love Me dearly. I dwell in their hearts with delight. But they are few. In convents too, there are souls that fill My Heart with joy. They bear My features; therefore the Heavenly Father looks upon them with special pleasure. They will be a marvel to Angels and men. Their number is very small. They are a defense for the world before the justice of the Heavenly Father and a means of obtaining mercy for the world. The love and sacrifice of these souls sustain the world in existence. The infidelity of a soul specially chosen by Me wounds My Heart most painfully. Such infidelities are swords which pierce My Heart.\n(Diary 367 Sister M.Faustina )",

But if there is anyone else in such a heart, I cannot bear it and quickly leave that heart, taking with Me all the gifts and graces I have prepared for the soul. And the soul does not even notice My going. After some time, inner emptiness and dissatisfaction will come to her attention. Oh, if only she would turn to Me then, (60) I would help her to cleanse her heart, and I would fulfill everything in her soul; but without her knowledge and consent, I cannot be the Master of her heart. \n(Diary 1683 ,Sister.
